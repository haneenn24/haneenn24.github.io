I presented *Sy-FAR: Symmetry-based Fair Adversarial Robustness* at multiple academic venues:

- **Tel Aviv University – PLUS Group**  
  Research seminar on fairness-aware adversarial training, symmetry constraints, and empirical results on face recognition and image classification.

- **The Hebrew University of Jerusalem – The 2nd Israeli Privacy and Fairness Workshop**  
  Workshop talk focusing on fairness–robustness trade-offs and subgroup fairness under physically realizable adversarial attacks.

- **ETH Zurich – Machine Learning and Cryptography**  
  Invited talk discussing symmetry-based fairness, adversarial robustness, and implications for security-critical machine learning systems.
