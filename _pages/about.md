## Haneen Najjar

I work in **Trustworthy Machine Learning**, focusing on **adversarial robustness, fairness, and security-critical ML systems**, with an emphasis on computer vision and physically realizable attacks.

My research studies how to build **robust and fair ML models** under realistic threat models (e.g., eyeglasses and occlusion attacks), and how enforcing **symmetry** between class pairs can improve both robustness and fairness.
