I am **Haneen Najjar**, a researcher and applied machine learning engineer working on **Trustworthy Machine Learning**, with a focus on **adversarial robustness, fairness, and security** in computer vision and graph learning.

My graduate research at **Tel Aviv University** studies security-critical ML systems (e.g., face recognition) under **physically realizable attacks** (eyeglasses and occlusion/patches). I developed **Sy-FAR**, a symmetry-based approach for **fair adversarial robustness**, showing that encouraging *symmetry* between class pairs can improve both class-level and subgroup-level robustness fairness.  
(*Sy-FAR is accepted to USENIX Security 2026; arXiv:2509.12939.*)

**Research interests**
- Adversarial robustness (targeted & untargeted, physically realizable attacks)
- Fairness in security-critical ML (class-level & subgroup-level robustness fairness)
- Trustworthy computer vision and graph learning
- ML security, privacy, and deployment constraints

**Industry**
I have 8+ years of experience across **Mellanox / NVIDIA / Hailo**, bridging research and production and building reproducible ML pipelines for real-world systems.

**Volunteering**
I mentor in technology education programs (e.g., Alice Code), supporting women professionals and undergraduates entering high-tech.
