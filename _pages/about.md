## Haneen Najjar

I work in **Trustworthy Machine Learning**, focusing on **adversarial robustness, fairness, and security-critical ML systems**, with an emphasis on computer vision and physically realizable attacks.

My research studies how to build **robust and fair ML models** under realistic threat models (e.g., eyeglasses and occlusion attacks), and how enforcing **symmetry** between class pairs can improve both robustness and fairness.

## Research Domain

My work is centered on **Trustworthy Machine Learning**, including:

- Adversarial robustness (targeted & untargeted attacks)  
- Physically realizable attacks (eyeglasses, occlusion, patches)  
- Fairness in security-critical ML systems  
- Symmetry-based robustness and subgroup fairness  
- Trustworthy computer vision and graph learning  
- ML security and privacy

## Industry Experience

**NVIDIA**  
*Senior Software Engineer → Team Lead*  
I led and managed engineering teams working on high-performance networking software and infrastructure.  
My work bridged large-scale systems engineering and ML deployment constraints in production environments.

**Hailo Technologies**  
*Senior Software Engineer – Pretrained Deep Learning Models and Model Optimization*  
I led deep learning model development and optimization for edge AI deployment.  
Responsibilities included training pipelines, model compression, robustness considerations, and deployment-ready optimization.
